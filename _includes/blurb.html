    To conduct research using any DiRAC or HPC facility, users need to use
    batch jobs to fairly share the available resources. It is therefore
    essential that users understand how a batch system like SLURM works and
    how to use it effectvely. This course will give a user the skills to run
    codes on the DiRAC system, i.e. an understanding of the batch queuing
    system, the role of job scripts and how to make sure that the runtime
    environment used by the job is correct.

    Following this course, the learner will be able to:

    <ul>
        <li>Understand and use the SLURM job queuing system.</li>
        <li>Submit, monitor, and control a job using SLURM.</li>
        <li>Use module commands to prepare a job's environment within a job script.</li>
